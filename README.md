# Slice-Em-Up
To play, download the zip file and run the exe, WASD controls, Spacebar to phase forward in a direction, and hold shift to run.
First unity game I created in order to get used to the engine.
it is a round based survival game with new enemies being added in every 5 rounds up until round 15
each enemy has a special mechanic
